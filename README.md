# TensorFlow Android Camera Demo

This folder contains an example application utilizing TensorFlow for Android
devices.

## Description

The demos in this folder are designed to give straightforward samples of using
TensorFlow in mobile applications.

Inference is done using the [TensorFlow Android Inference Interface](../../../tensorflow/contrib/android),
which may be built separately if you want a standalone library to drop into your
existing application. Object tracking and YUV -> RGB conversion is handled by
libtensorflow_demo.so.
